&lt;a href=&#34;https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/#resources&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Backward Design&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let students know in reverse
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your learning goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you assess those goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you achieve those goals through teaching?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Assessments&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note explicitly that the course is NOT graded on a curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grading is detrimental to learning and to teaching
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing grading on effort vs accuracy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow grades to be re-earned in office hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If ability to generalize is valued a project is a must&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily self-graded quizzes may be a good thing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-grading practices meta-thinking, how did I go wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces grading burden on me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homework extensions are onerous but compassionate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grading on the median with no extensions is one option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropping a lot of assignments is another
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students with extreme difficulties may have extra assignments dropped from grade rather than extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-my-learning-goals-&#34;&gt;What Are My Learning Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://teaching.uncc.edu/sites/teaching.uncc.edu/files/media/files/file/GoalsAndObjectives/Bloom.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bloom&amp;rsquo;s Taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way of classifying increasingly ambitious learning objectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three taxonomies for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge-based goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills-based foals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affective goals (related to values, attitudes, interests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-will-i-assess-those-goals&#34;&gt;How Will I Assess Those Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both during the course and at the end of the course. Designing 
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/teaching/assessment&#34;&gt;assessments&lt;/a&gt;
 is a whole separate can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-will-i-achieve-those-goals-&#34;&gt;How Will I Achieve Those Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the nitty-gritty of lesson planning, etc, now is also a good time to write a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/designing-your-course-and-syllabus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;
. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve done that I think I personally will benefit from calendaring. This will help me remember little things like: two weeks from today is the exam, I need to write it so I can tell students about format, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;general-information-&#34;&gt;General information&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructor: Connie Okasaki (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:cokasaki@uw.edu&#34;&gt;cokasaki@uw.edu&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAs: Someone (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:someone@uw.edu&#34;&gt;someone@uw.edu&lt;/a&gt;) and Someone Else (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:esomeone@uw.edu&#34;&gt;esomeone@uw.edu&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lecture Times: Tues &amp;amp; Thurs 10:00-11:20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab Time: W 11:00-12:50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course Website: here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;objective-&#34;&gt;Objective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this course is to provide students with an introductory understanding of the probability and statistics. Both play an important role in nearly all aspects of society, and your ability to understand, interpret, and critique data and the statistics used to analyze these data will provide you with an important foundation, regardless of career choice. After completing this course you will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand different types of data and how they are collected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the basis of distributions and the information that can be inferred from them
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to apply distributions to make simple predictions of probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand different types of basic data analysis, and how to interpret results from them
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to design and apply your own basic data analysis, and interpret the results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to critique simple statistical analyses that exhibit a variety of common flaws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to apply the concepts from this class to a learn a new model or analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you will also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be excited about the application of probability and statistics in the biosciences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel more comfortable using equations to model reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel more comfortable using code to analyze data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;assessment-&#34;&gt;Assessment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that grading is detrimental to both teaching and learning. While feedback is a valuable part of learning, numerical grades have been shown to distract from feedback. Furthermore, assigning numerical grades takes up time that I might otherwise spend improving my teaching. I have therefore designed this course to maximize feedback and minimize grading. Since I am required to assign numerical grades I have attempted to split your numerical grade between effort-based and accuracy-based grading approximately evenly. Notably this course is NOT graded on a curve. Your grade will be based on the effort you apply and the mastery you demonstrate, but never on the performance of other students. The following events will be graded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quizzes (20%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be in-class quizzes during every lecture. These quizzes will last approximately 5 minutes, and will test understanding of material from the previous lecture. They will begin promptly at the start of class. After the quiz is completed, solutions will be presented and you will be peer-graded on a 2 point scale. 1 point will be awarded for a demonstrated effort to solve the problem. 1 point will be awarded for the correct answer. Full credit on the quiz may be regained by attending office hours and solving a similar problem with the help of myself or a TA. Each quiz will have 1 extra credit point. This point will pertain to the content from the reading, and cannot be made-up in office hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labs (20%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in some form of coding is an increasingly important tool for any working statistician. Comfort working with code is even more broadly important. In lab you will practice these skills using the programming language R by applying them to the concepts you learn in lecture. You will turn in your code using Jupyter notebooks, a general tool for incorporating data analysis directly into a document. Attendance and good-will effort at lab is sufficient to earn 50% of lab credit, with the other 50% dependent on the accuracy of your submission. If you do not attend lab your grade for the lab will be entirely based on accuracy. Labs are designed to be finishable within the lab time, however you will have until the end of the day to submit your final code. Labs will be machine graded for accuracy, but feedback about your coding style will also be provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework (30%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each week you will turn in two homework problems. These problems will relate to the content of the previous week: both the theory you learn in lecture and the code you learn in lab. You will turn in a total of 7 homework assignments. I will drop the lowest 2 of these grades. I am allowing a generous 2-drop policy because I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; grant extensions on homework assignments. Extensions delay the release of grading rubrics and answer keys and therefore inhibit the learning of other students. They are also extremely difficult to keep track of as an instructor. These 2 drops are intended primarily to allow you up to 2 &amp;ldquo;extenuating circumstances&amp;rdquo; weeks where you are unable to turn in the homework due to circumstances outside your control. This should be more than sufficient to cover most normal illnesses, family emergencies, and so on. In the event you have an ongoing situation which is inhibiting your ability to engage with this class over a period of more than two weeks, please contact me directly as soon as possible to work out an accommodation. Regardless of how accommodating I&amp;rsquo;d like to be, if you complete less than half of the homework assignments, it will be extremely difficult for you to succeed in this class. To accommodate technical difficulties with submission you may turn in your assignment up to 8 hours late with no penalty, but no other late submissions will be accepted. Homework assignments will be due one week after they are posted and will be graded before the next homework assignment is due. Homework assignments will be due every two weeks in the second half of the course to accommodate the final project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midterm Exam (10%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a foundational course, simple memorization of facts is valuable. You will use these facts constantly in higher level courses and having to look up the results every time is a substantial mental drain. To assess your automatic recall, the final exam will be a closed-book exam consisting of 20 conceptual questions foundational to probability and statistics. This is intended to test automatic recall of facts and would take an expert less than a minute to complete. I have designed it to be a 20 minute exam. You will have a full 60 minutes to complete it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Project (20%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this course it is expected that you will be able to apply the concepts learned in this course to learn new material outside of class. If this isn&amp;rsquo;t the point of an education, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is. The final project will both teach and assess this ability. You will choose a (a) statistical test (b) statistical fallacy (c) probability distribution or (d) statistical model from the attached list. You will turn in a one page paper explaining the concept you chose (25% of project), a one page reflection on how you went about learning the concept (25%), and a two page Rmarkdown document applying the concept to a dataset of your choice and explaining your work (25%).  Note that if you choose (b) a statistical fallacy you will likely have to simulate data to demonstrate your understanding. The final 25% of your project grade will be based on the quality of feedback you give during peer review. You will turn in a draft of your final project two weeks before the final exam date. These drafts will be anonymized and distributed for peer review. You will receive peer review one week before the final exam date, and will turn in your final project on the day of the final exam. You will be required to schedule a 10 minute 1-on-1 meeting with me to discuss your project, and are encouraged to come to office hours for further feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra Credit (11%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am frequently asked about extra credit. The following extra credit is available in this course. You will obtain 1% extra credit for filling out the final course evaluation. You will indicate on your final project submission whether you completed the course evaluation. I can verify after grades are submitted whether or not you actually did, so do not lie. The remaining 10% extra credit can be obtained by doing the reading prior to each class and answering the extra credit questions on each quiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-grades-&#34;&gt;Final Grades&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grading scale will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;95% = 4.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% = 3.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;85% = 3.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% = 2.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75% = 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% = 1.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;65% = 1.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62% = 0.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;62% = 0.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate grades will be calculated according to a straightforward extension of this scale (i.e. 0.1 for every 1% in your final grade). To reiterate, I do believe that grading is detrimental to your learning as students. Therefore note that your grades on the quizzes (which you can make-up in office hours), labs (which you will receive substantial assistance with in lab section), the final project (which you can seek substantial guidance with over the second half of the course), and the extra credit (which is easily attainable be completing the readings) are all essentially effort-based. With full marks in these areas and only half marks in the accuracy-based homeworks and midterm you all have a straightforward path to earning an exemplary 91% or 3.6 grade. I therefore encourage you to focus on effort rather than grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;teaching-&#34;&gt;Teaching&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide you my slides and lecture notes prior to the start of class. I require you all to obtain a copy of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openintro.org/book/os&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OpenIntro Statistics&lt;/a&gt;
 which is available as a free pdf online. Each class I will post a set of readings you should complete for the following class. Completing these readings will give you the information you need to answer the extra credit questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;software-&#34;&gt;Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be required to use R in the JupyterHub environment hosted by UW-IT on the cloud. This allows all of you to work in a standardized environment and ensures that everyones code runs in exactly the same way. We will show you how to access and interact with JupyterHub in lab sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;inclusivity-and-course-conduct-&#34;&gt;Inclusivity and Course Conduct&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to make all students feel welcome in this class, regardless of your background, beliefs, identity, or learning needs. I also hope to help all students learn effectively and thrive in this class. I welcome feedback and suggestions as to how I may improve both my teaching and my classroom environment at any point in the course. I also think the syllabus is a poor place to make such a statement, so I hope that my actions in the classroom also make this clear to you. I hope in particular that I have explained my reasoning behind the two policies which I will strictly enforce &amp;ndash; the late policy and the extensions policy. I plan to release answer keys almost immediately upon submission of homework assignments, to allow for extremely fast feedback, since you can check your answers right away. I cannot do this if I allow late submissions and extensions. I hope that my drop policy is sufficiently generous to offset this, but if you feel that this policy has affected or will affect you unfairly, please reach out and I will do my best to find an accommodation for you &amp;ndash; likely this will involve an alternative assignment. Two specific cases where this may be called for are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;disability-accommodations-&#34;&gt;Disability Accommodations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial that all students in this class have access to the full range of learning experiences. At the University of Washington, it is the policy and practice to create inclusive and accessible learning environments. To request academic accommodations due to a disability, please contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS), 011 Mary Gates Hall, (206) 543-8924, or &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu&#34;&gt;uwdrs@uw.edu&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a letter from DRS indicating that you have a disability which requires academic accommodations, please present the letter to the instructor so we can discuss the accommodations needed for this class. If you have, or think you have, a temporary or permanent disability that impacts your participation in any course, please also contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS) at: 206-543-8924 V / 206-543-8925 TDD / &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu&#34;&gt;uwdrs@uw.edu&lt;/a&gt; e-mail. More information can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/&#34;&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;religious-accommodations-&#34;&gt;Religious Accommodations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW&amp;rsquo;s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is a vailable at Religious Accommodations Policy (&lt;a href=&#34;https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/)&#34;&gt;https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/)&lt;/a&gt;. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form (&lt;a href=&#34;https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/)&#34;&gt;https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grading</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/grading/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/grading/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arrticles/PMC4041495&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Teaching More by Grading Less&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grading is a ubiquitious but surprisingly recent phenomenon. The current A-D+F system only gained popularity in the 1940s. Grades are intended as feedback on performance, motivators of student effort, tools for comparing students, and objective evaluations of student knowledge. However, these goals are rarely achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, more qualitative feedback describing how work could be improved is more effective, and grades often distract from this feedback. Grades dampen intrinsic motivation, enhance fear of failure, reduce interest, decrease enjoyment, increase anxiety, stimulate aviodance, heighten competitiveness, and even hamper performance. Grading systems that reward effort seem to have better reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grades are further unhelpful as a tool for comparing students. Curve-grading might be thought to be the fairest approach but in reality this mostly stimulates competition, while divorcing grades from actual mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, grades are inconsistent and subjective measures of mastery. They vary wildly between different graders, and even between the same grader over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does work? The authors propose (a) balancing accuracy-based with effort-based grading (b) providing meaningful feedback through self- and peer-evaluation (c) avoiding curving (d) blind grading when possible and (e) providing rubrics for any graded assessments that are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Broad Strokes of Learning</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/core-takeaways/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/core-takeaways/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;nine-basic-principles-&#34;&gt;Nine basic principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanations of human learning in terms of innate talent are consistently undermined by research which states that substantial amounts of time, energy, instruction, and effort are required to develop mastery of any subject area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can naturally learn from any information, but to learn effectively that information has to be organized in a way that matches how our minds are organized. Minds are organized differently for different people, and even change as we age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brain has severe, inherent limitations and deep processing becomes impossible when those limits are reached (cognitive load principle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People learn particularly well from other people, through directed instruction and feedback (social learning theory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People put in a lot more effort when they are confident that worthwhile goals are achievable in the short term. Activating effort and motivation is difficult but not impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term goals are highly motivating, but when they conflict with valuable long-term goals we must develop and use strategies to control impulses and delay gratificatoin (personal regulation through self-control).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learners are humans, and other parts of them &amp;ndash; self esteem, sociality, etc &amp;ndash; must be maintained and acknowledged during the learning process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are fundamentally social, down to the neurological level. This sociality can be used as a tool (social brain hypothesis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas about learning that are contradicted by scientific evidence abound. Many of these ideas can be harmful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1-&#34;&gt;Section 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mind may not be &amp;ldquo;designed for thinking&amp;rdquo; and requires time and effort to think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers need to recognize how difficult tasks are for beginners. Focus should be not on material but on the actual process of moving from not knowing to knowing. To do this students need a safe environment to acknowledge they don&#39;t understand. We can only holld so much in our cognitive centers, so it is important to ``overlearn&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; basic concepts until it is ingrained and automatic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1-&#34;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students do not dislike school, but tolerate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brain may not be &amp;ldquo;designed&amp;rdquo; for abstract thinking and as a result school is a taxing process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking requires a large investment of resources for an uncertain outcome (understanding) and risk-averse humans prefer to invest these resources in crossing seemingly achievable &amp;ldquo;knowledge gaps&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;knowledge chasms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2-&#34;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experts may be &amp;ldquo;worse&amp;rdquo; at teaching than novices. The &amp;ldquo;expert blind spot effect&amp;rdquo; explains this:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experts forget how difficult it was to learn something in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a gap between the advanced level on which experts conceptualize of a topic and the short-term learning needs of students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;however, this abstract thinking may help students transfer their learning to related areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2-&#34;&gt;Section 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major ideas about acquisition, memory retention, mental storage, and overload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning need not be conscious, we can only think about so much at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to develop a vocabulary for learning, and need multiple strategies for learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges: learning styles (i.e. spatial, verbal, kinaesthetic), Mozart effects, multitasking, digital natives, and whether the Internet is really changing how we think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3-&#34;&gt;Section 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-esteem follows success more often than predicting it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building confidence is still important though: in order to maintain positive views of ourselves we build explanations (I cannot; rather than I did not work hard enough) that help our self esteem but hurt our learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning situations are often distracting and knowing how to pay attention to learning is important, but tiring. It is important to know when to stop thinking to save cognitive resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Why Don&#39;t Students Like School?</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-01/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-01/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no serious evidence that students, on average, actively &lt;em&gt;dislike&lt;/em&gt; school. Rather they are neutral, or mildly positive towards school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frequent challenge faced by teachers is the apathy of students on an individual level, after working so hard to provide an engaging learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VL puts forward the following hypothesis, following researcher Daniel Willingham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human brain is not primarily designed for &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo;: it is designed for sociality, for language learning, for spatial reasoning, etc. Higher level reasoning is not the primary purpose and is, on average, very difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that thinking uses up limited resources very quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking someone to invest this level of effort/resources is a hard task. The outcome of a &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; task could be positive (better understanding) or negative (no progress). Humans are risk-averse and are unlikely to invest effort if they cannot see a likely short-term pay-off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means the best way to get effort out of students is to show them short-term goals that seem achievable: &amp;ldquo;we are motivated by knowledge gaps, but put off by knowledge chasms.&amp;rdquo; We cannot be curious about everything, and are instead curious about the things we feel we can understand with little additional effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ease with which people can access information has a large effect on how they use that information, and how they feel about that information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rely much more heavily on memory than thinking: it is generally easier to remember a previous result than to derive it from scratch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand early on what the professors expectations are, in detail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I expected to attend class?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will we hold regular TA meetings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I grading, writing answer keys, giving guest lectures, holding office hours, holding review sessions, leading discussion sections, responding to online questions, communicating from the instructor to the class, etc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know what the instructor is emphasizing in class&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Assessments</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/assessment/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/assessment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from UWs TA 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/assessing-and-improving-teaching/assessing-student-lerning-grading&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four recommendations from UW:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create clear grading criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate these criteria to students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give constructive feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employ time management strategies when grading large amounts of work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect students to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus their time and effort on the things with the highest grading weights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be sensitive about their grades, and ask about grading-related topics frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete Actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create, communicate, and remind students about clear grading criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create clear expectations about edge cases like late papers, exam timing, grade changes, and typos on assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep thorough records of evaluations, and keep for a while after the quarter is over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promptly document interactions with unhappy students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See further resources on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/teaching/writing-tests&#34;&gt;writing tests&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/grading-student-work&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;assigning grades&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/resources/teaching/evaluating-students&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;evaluating students&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grading-&#34;&gt;Grading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/grading-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Grading&lt;/a&gt;
 is really hard. First thing to make clear is that I am using mastery-based (i.e. individual skills) rather than norm-referenced (i.e. relative to each other) grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure students know what to expect
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is being measured, how is it being measured, what does this have to do with the course at large?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do students need to recall information, recognize patterns, draw inferences, make connections, construct an argument, or what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery-based grading requires very clear measurable goals and objectives
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely want to make some re-adjustment of pre-set expectations based on actual performance. Perhaps the test really was too hard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cheating-&#34;&gt;Cheating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to stop it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain clearly what is and is not allowed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage students to seek help:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often students cheat because they are doing poorly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage them to schedule a meeting and/or come to office hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give alternating versions of exams (different orders if not different questions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly walk around the room and observe students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the exam mark answer sheets in such a way that alterations cannot be made (possibly scan a copy of each exam if possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give an alternate exam version for make-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homework assignments are difficult to monitor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UW recommends lowering the amount of the grade HW is worth&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace homework with in-class quizzes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final projects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about whether students may have done similar projects in other classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do when it happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a specific 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/report-academic-misconduct&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reporting tool&lt;/a&gt;
 but for TAs it probably goes through the instructor first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Classroom Practices</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/classroom-practices/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn everyone&amp;rsquo;s name by week 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce myself:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name/pronouns, background, formality, how/when to reach me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notecards:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred name/pronunciation/pronouns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accommodation requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expectations:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grading/deadline criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classroom policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my commitments as a teacher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how I intend to teach/assess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add codes/course conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;course schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick (ungraded) quiz to gauge background? Self-reported pre-assessment of background knowledge? Resources for filling in gaps? ``Common Sense Inventory:&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; determine whether 15 statements related to course content are true or false?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homework 0: voluntary/mandatory office hour?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is time left to teach, model what the rest of the course will be like. Think about whether registration has stabilized and whether to teach foundational material, or just interesting stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tie things into what I&amp;rsquo;m excited about. Students can tell if you&amp;rsquo;re into it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give real world examples/applications, particularly in my own work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up a high degree of connectivity, explain how things relate to other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/engaging-students-in-learning/promoting-student-engagement-through-active-learning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Active learning&lt;/a&gt;
 is good. Give students a chance to practice that thing they just learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;office-hours-&#34;&gt;Office Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most important thing is getting people to come in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give feedback on what&amp;rsquo;s been done so far and offer direction and general guidance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them to explain their work and thought process so far
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If that leaves a blank, ask them to solve an easier problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to get them to ask specific questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is X true?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this specific logic follow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask leading questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to understand what their thought process is, they are likely coming from a different background than me and will think about things in a different way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work through the homework and exams ahead of time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to anticipate sticking points and wrong turns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know and communicate the instructors expectations and emphasize this material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Course Design</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/course-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/course-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from UWs TA 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/designing-your-course-and-syllabus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/#resources&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Backward Design&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design a course in reverse by considering
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your learning goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you assess those goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you achieve those goals through teaching?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this way everything done in the course is intentional and working towards an established goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-are-my-students-&#34;&gt;Who Are My Students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I even get to learning goals, also consider: who are my students? Why are they taking my course? What can I expect that they already know? What range of backgrounds might the have? What do I expect them to struggle with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-my-learning-goals-&#34;&gt;What Are My Learning Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://teaching.uncc.edu/sites/teaching.uncc.edu/files/media/files/file/GoalsAndObjectives/Bloom.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Blooms Taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way of classifying increasingly ambitious learning objectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three taxonomies for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge-based goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills-based foals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affective goals (related to values, attitudes, interests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-will-i-assess-those-goals&#34;&gt;How Will I Assess Those Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both during the course and at the end of the course. Designing 
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/teaching/assessment&#34;&gt;assessments&lt;/a&gt;
 is a whole separate can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-will-i-achieve-those-goals-&#34;&gt;How Will I Achieve Those Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the nitty-gritty of lesson planning, etc, now is also a good time to write a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/designing-your-course-and-syllabus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;
. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve done that I think I personally will benefit from calendaring. This will help me remember little things like: two weeks from today is the exam, I need to write it so I can tell students about format, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tests</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/writing-tests/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/writing-tests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from UWs TA 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/constructing-tests&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why am I testing:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to monitor progress and adjust the pace of the course?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to motivate students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide data for a grade?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to challenge students to apply concepts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use this information to design the exam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my test consistent with my teaching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;post/teaching/course-design&#34;&gt;Backwards design&lt;/a&gt;
 will help with this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the test emphasizes analysis and synthesis, make sure class time does as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the students know what to expect?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the test match my stated course goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I reviewed the material on the test/explained what will be tested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does my exam test a range of learning?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do students who have not mastered everything have room to demonstrate growth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple choice exams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to grade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good for testing recall and facts, difficult to test analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure question is clear without reading the answers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can a prepared student or colleague answer the question as a free response?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid making the right answer stand out for the wrong reasons (i.e. grammer, length)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assess the exam questions afterwards:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which questions were most difficult?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were there questions which most students with high-grades missed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of exam format, assessing it after the fact is important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I test what I thought I was testing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I test what I tught?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I test what I emphasized?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I test what I really wanted the students to learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If answers to these questions come back no, possibly go back to the Backwards Design and rethink course/assessment structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
