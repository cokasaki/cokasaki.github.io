      <h1 id="general-information">General information</h1>
<p>Instructor: Connie Okasaki (<a href="mailto:cokasaki@uw.edu">cokasaki@uw.edu</a>)</p>
<p>TAs: Someone (<a href="mailto:someone@uw.edu">someone@uw.edu</a>) and Someone Else (<a href="mailto:esomeone@uw.edu">esomeone@uw.edu</a>)</p>
<p>Lecture Times: Tues &amp; Thurs 10:00-11:20</p>
<p>Lab Time: W 11:00-12:50</p>
<p>Course Website: here</p>
<h1 id="objective">Objective</h1>
<p>The objective of this course is to provide students with an introductory understanding of the probability and statistics. Both play an important role in nearly all aspects of society, and your ability to understand, interpret, and critique data and the statistics used to analyze these data will provide you with an important foundation, regardless of career choice. After completing this course you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand different types of data and how they are collected</li>
<li>Understand the basis of distributions and the information that can be inferred from them
<ul>
<li>Be able to apply distributions to make simple predictions of probability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understand different types of basic data analysis, and how to interpret results from them
<ul>
<li>Be able to design and apply your own basic data analysis, and interpret the results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be able to critique simple statistical analyses that exhibit a variety of common flaws</li>
<li>Be able to apply the concepts from this class to a learn a new model or analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that you will also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be excited about the application of probability and statistics in the biosciences</li>
<li>Feel more comfortable using equations to model reality</li>
<li>Feel more comfortable using code to analyze data</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="assessment">Assessment</h1>
<p>I believe that grading is detrimental to both teaching and learning. While feedback is a valuable part of learning, numerical grades have been shown to distract from feedback. Furthermore, assigning numerical grades takes up time that I might otherwise spend improving my teaching. I have therefore designed this course to maximize feedback and minimize grading. Since I am required to assign numerical grades I have attempted to split your numerical grade between effort-based and accuracy-based grading approximately evenly. Notably this course is NOT graded on a curve. Your grade will be based on the effort you apply and the mastery you demonstrate, but never on the performance of other students. The following events will be graded:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quizzes (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be in-class quizzes during every lecture. These quizzes will last approximately 5 minutes, and will test understanding of material from the previous lecture. They will begin promptly at the start of class. After the quiz is completed, solutions will be presented and you will be peer-graded on a 2 point scale. 1 point will be awarded for a demonstrated effort to solve the problem. 1 point will be awarded for the correct answer. Full credit on the quiz may be regained by attending office hours and solving a similar problem with the help of myself or a TA. Each quiz will have 1 extra credit point. This point will pertain to the content from the reading, and cannot be made-up in office hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labs (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Proficiency in some form of coding is an increasingly important tool for any working statistician. Comfort working with code is even more broadly important. In lab you will practice these skills using the programming language R by applying them to the concepts you learn in lecture. You will turn in your code using Jupyter notebooks, a general tool for incorporating data analysis directly into a document. Attendance and good-will effort at lab is sufficient to earn 50% of lab credit, with the other 50% dependent on the accuracy of your submission. If you do not attend lab your grade for the lab will be entirely based on accuracy. Labs are designed to be finishable within the lab time, however you will have until the end of the day to submit your final code. Labs will be machine graded for accuracy, but feedback about your coding style will also be provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homework (30%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Each week you will turn in two homework problems. These problems will relate to the content of the previous week: both the theory you learn in lecture and the code you learn in lab. You will turn in a total of 7 homework assignments. I will drop the lowest 2 of these grades. I am allowing a generous 2-drop policy because I will <em>not</em> grant extensions on homework assignments. Extensions delay the release of grading rubrics and answer keys and therefore inhibit the learning of other students. They are also extremely difficult to keep track of as an instructor. These 2 drops are intended primarily to allow you up to 2 &ldquo;extenuating circumstances&rdquo; weeks where you are unable to turn in the homework due to circumstances outside your control. This should be more than sufficient to cover most normal illnesses, family emergencies, and so on. In the event you have an ongoing situation which is inhibiting your ability to engage with this class over a period of more than two weeks, please contact me directly as soon as possible to work out an accommodation. Regardless of how accommodating I&rsquo;d like to be, if you complete less than half of the homework assignments, it will be extremely difficult for you to succeed in this class. To accommodate technical difficulties with submission you may turn in your assignment up to 8 hours late with no penalty, but no other late submissions will be accepted. Homework assignments will be due one week after they are posted and will be graded before the next homework assignment is due. Homework assignments will be due every two weeks in the second half of the course to accommodate the final project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Midterm Exam (10%)</p>
<ul>
<li>In a foundational course, simple memorization of facts is valuable. You will use these facts constantly in higher level courses and having to look up the results every time is a substantial mental drain. To assess your automatic recall, the final exam will be a closed-book exam consisting of 20 conceptual questions foundational to probability and statistics. This is intended to test automatic recall of facts and would take an expert less than a minute to complete. I have designed it to be a 20 minute exam. You will have a full 60 minutes to complete it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final Project (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>In this course it is expected that you will be able to apply the concepts learned in this course to learn new material outside of class. If this isn&rsquo;t the point of an education, I don&rsquo;t know what is. The final project will both teach and assess this ability. You will choose a (a) statistical test (b) statistical fallacy (c) probability distribution or (d) statistical model from the attached list. You will turn in a one page paper explaining the concept you chose (25% of project), a one page reflection on how you went about learning the concept (25%), and a two page Rmarkdown document applying the concept to a dataset of your choice and explaining your work (25%).  Note that if you choose (b) a statistical fallacy you will likely have to simulate data to demonstrate your understanding. The final 25% of your project grade will be based on the quality of feedback you give during peer review. You will turn in a draft of your final project two weeks before the final exam date. These drafts will be anonymized and distributed for peer review. You will receive peer review one week before the final exam date, and will turn in your final project on the day of the final exam. You will be required to schedule a 10 minute 1-on-1 meeting with me to discuss your project, and are encouraged to come to office hours for further feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extra Credit (11%)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am frequently asked about extra credit. The following extra credit is available in this course. You will obtain 1% extra credit for filling out the final course evaluation. You will indicate on your final project submission whether you completed the course evaluation. I can verify after grades are submitted whether or not you actually did, so do not lie. The remaining 10% extra credit can be obtained by doing the reading prior to each class and answering the extra credit questions on each quiz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="final-grades">Final Grades</h1>
<p>The grading scale will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>95% = 4.0</li>
<li>90% = 3.5</li>
<li>85% = 3.0</li>
<li>80% = 2.5</li>
<li>75% = 2.0</li>
<li>70% = 1.5</li>
<li>65% = 1.0</li>
<li>62% = 0.7</li>
<li>&lt;62% = 0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Intermediate grades will be calculated according to a straightforward extension of this scale (i.e. 0.1 for every 1% in your final grade). To reiterate, I do believe that grading is detrimental to your learning as students. Therefore note that your grades on the quizzes (which you can make-up in office hours), labs (which you will receive substantial assistance with in lab section), the final project (which you can seek substantial guidance with over the second half of the course), and the extra credit (which is easily attainable be completing the readings) are all essentially effort-based. With full marks in these areas and only half marks in the accuracy-based homeworks and midterm you all have a straightforward path to earning an exemplary 91% or 3.6 grade. I therefore encourage you to focus on effort rather than grades.</p>
<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>
<p>I will provide you my slides and lecture notes prior to the start of class. I require you all to obtain a copy of 
<a href="https://www.openintro.org/book/os" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenIntro Statistics</a>
 which is available as a free pdf online. Each class I will post a set of readings you should complete for the following class. Completing these readings will give you the information you need to answer the extra credit questions.</p>
<h1 id="software">Software</h1>
<p>You will be required to use R in the JupyterHub environment hosted by UW-IT on the cloud. This allows all of you to work in a standardized environment and ensures that everyones code runs in exactly the same way. We will show you how to access and interact with JupyterHub in lab sessions.</p>
<h1 id="inclusivity-and-course-conduct">Inclusivity and Course Conduct</h1>
<p>I hope to make all students feel welcome in this class, regardless of your background, beliefs, identity, or learning needs. I also hope to help all students learn effectively and thrive in this class. I welcome feedback and suggestions as to how I may improve both my teaching and my classroom environment at any point in the course. I also think the syllabus is a poor place to make such a statement, so I hope that my actions in the classroom also make this clear to you. I hope in particular that I have explained my reasoning behind the two policies which I will strictly enforce &ndash; the late policy and the extensions policy. I plan to release answer keys almost immediately upon submission of homework assignments, to allow for extremely fast feedback, since you can check your answers right away. I cannot do this if I allow late submissions and extensions. I hope that my drop policy is sufficiently generous to offset this, but if you feel that this policy has affected or will affect you unfairly, please reach out and I will do my best to find an accommodation for you &ndash; likely this will involve an alternative assignment. Two specific cases where this may be called for are outlined below.</p>
<h1 id="disability-accommodations">Disability Accommodations</h1>
<p>It is crucial that all students in this class have access to the full range of learning experiences. At the University of Washington, it is the policy and practice to create inclusive and accessible learning environments. To request academic accommodations due to a disability, please contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS), 011 Mary Gates Hall, (206) 543-8924, or <a href="mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu">uwdrs@uw.edu</a>. If you have a letter from DRS indicating that you have a disability which requires academic accommodations, please present the letter to the instructor so we can discuss the accommodations needed for this class. If you have, or think you have, a temporary or permanent disability that impacts your participation in any course, please also contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS) at: 206-543-8924 V / 206-543-8925 TDD / <a href="mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu">uwdrs@uw.edu</a> e-mail. More information can be found at <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/">http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/</a></p>
<h1 id="religious-accommodations">Religious Accommodations</h1>
<p>Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW&rsquo;s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is a vailable at Religious Accommodations Policy (<a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/)">https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/)</a>. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form (<a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/)">https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/)</a>.</p>
