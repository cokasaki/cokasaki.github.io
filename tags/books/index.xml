      <title>Teaching for automaticity in basic academic skill</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-07/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After large amounts of time spent practicing and recalling information, that information becames automatic. It is quickly and subconsciously accessible and does not impose upon expensive higher-level thought processes. When information is not automatic, these thought processes require are extremely tiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is a natural example: when we read our eyes &lt;em&gt;saccade&lt;/em&gt; or quickly refixate about every quarter-second. The eye focuses on the next word in sequence and we process each word individually for meaning at that pace. Missing the meaning of even a single word can threaten the understanding of the whole sentence, and so the mind automatizes this process after months or years of practice. Moreover, in order to synthesize and comprehend longer sentences and arguments, words must be processes fast enough for the whole argument to be held in working memory. Slow reading due to lack of automaticity threatens this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory that certain students struggle with reading comprehension because they are slow to process individual words is known as the &lt;em&gt;simple theory of reading&lt;/em&gt;. Even though a child may understand each word individually, they cannot comprehend the whole sentence unless they can process words fast enough to intake the whole sentence more or less at once. This automatic processing is not possible without many many hours of intensive self-directed practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number facts follow a similar pattern. Although mathematics instruction often focuses on &amp;ldquo;surface learning&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;deep understanding,&amp;rdquo; there is almost no meaningful distinction between these, particularly in early education. The importance of automaticity and reducing cogniftive load is such that basic drilling of sums and products is necessary to develop future math skills. Furthermore speed of access of these number facts (among others) is associated with higher confidence and positive feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately these important automatic skills can only be developed through large amounts of invested time, over the course of years. No one teacher can be responsible for these processes, but all must contribute for successful education to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of feedback</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-08/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teachers have long lists of reasons why feedback is important. Students overwhelmingly look to feedback for only one thing: how to improve their work to succeed next time. Students tend to focus on the future over the past, and often interpret even constructive feedback on past work as personal attacks and can react defensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of negative events is stronger than the impact of positive events, but despite this teachers consistently give more negative feedback than positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The recitation method and the nature of classroom learning</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-06/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-06/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recitation method, also known as the IRE cycle (initiation-response-evaluation) or the CDR method (conventional-direct-recitation) refers to a particular pattern used commonly by teachers. This pattern has stayed in place despite considerable criticism for hundreds of years. The cycle progresses from a teacher initiating an interaction, inviting a response (e.g. asking a question), and evaluating the response before beginning the cycle anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system has been criticized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions asked are mainly low level, calling only for simplistic answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one student is active at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education is reduced to receiving pre-packaged knowledge and demonstrating its retention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classroom conversation is inherently predictable, task-oriented, but unstimulating. Learning becomes sterile, non-emotional, and rule-bound.
This system is ubiquitous around the world. However, about 75% of classtime in an average classroom is spent on the instruction stage. Less than 1% of time was spent on open questions that might ask for complex responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recitation method has some advantages associated with overcrowded classrooms and the need to teach a rigid set curriculum. It is appealing to teachers because they remain in control of the interaction at virtual all stages and may speed up or slow down to any pace. However students learn little from just hearing teachers talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major principles of learning is that the learner needs to be actively responding to get anything out of it. They do not necessarily need to respond overtly, they just need to be actively engaged. This is difficult to maintain for the long periods of time that teachers generally speak for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;redundancy effect&lt;/em&gt; identified by cognitive load researchers states that when teachers talk for long periods of time, students are unable to determine which information is relevant and which is not. Effective teachers will explain material extremely well, but very briefly. Students will not learn simply by listening for longer periods of time. Mental focus drops up after perhaps 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two theories underly this drop in mental focus, or &lt;em&gt;mind wandering&lt;/em&gt;. One theory, known as &lt;em&gt;ego depletion&lt;/em&gt; is that one&amp;rsquo;s ability to focus intensely actually literally runs out through exhaustion, measured by brain glucose. So, your mind wanders in order to build up energy for the next upcoming demand that will be placed upon it. The second theory is known as &lt;em&gt;cascading inattention&lt;/em&gt;. This refers to when the mind is unable to clearly process and organize incoming information and fit it into a simple framework and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative is formulated as the PDC (progressive-discovery-constructivist) approach although the chapter did not explain what this approach entails. Another alternative is tha Paideia model which states that learning takes place in three parts: didactic instruction, Socratic questioning, and coached product. Each of these hsould take up a third of time. However, Socratic questioning is the key and entails more than just students talking. Questions must promote higher order thinking; student talk is a means not an end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time as a global indicator of classroom learning</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-05/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-05/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your pedagogical philosophy has no bearing on student outcomes unless you spend time on the issues you claim to emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies used four different measures of time (see VL pg. 37) each a subset of the last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocated time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time as programmed proactively, on documents and curriculum plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;problems: interruptions, visitors, announcements, transitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved by: school mandated policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructional time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actual time genuinely available for instruction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;problems: poor classroom management, allowing time to be hijacked by low-priority issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved by: managerial skill and time prioritization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaged time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time student actually pays attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;problems: students not knowing what to focus on, distractions, boredom, fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved by: clear instructions and meaningful tasks, encouragement, feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Academic learning time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time when student is learning and responding successfully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;problems: student may be unsuccessful despite effort, gaps in prior knowledge, tasks too challenging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved by: individualized guidance, encouragement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of time dedicated to a particular task varies wildly between different teachers. However the most critical measure of time is academic learning time. Higher tiers can be used to help maximize academic learning time but this is the level that is most consistently correlated with student success. However, just spending time with a topic does not necessarily imply improvement. Rather deliberate practice with a focus on improvement is necessary, with critical components including guidance, instruction, goal setting, and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is particular important for forming deep understanding and connections between topics. Comparing curriculums streamlined to cover the same material in shorter or longer periods of time, there was no difference in test scores on surface-level multiple choice questions. However, free response questions meant to test deep understanding and connections between topics showed wild variation with much higher scores for the students that took the longer courses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The teacher-student relationship</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-03/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-03/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;empathy gap&lt;/em&gt; occurs when people are relatively unable to put themselves in the place of another person. Deep levels of empathy are difficult if you have never had the same experience as another person, or if you are not currently experiencing anything similar. It is easiest to empathize with people whose experiences you are currently mirroring, harder if you have mirrored them in the past, and hardest if you have never experienced them at all. Children in particular do not develop the ability to deeply understand others&amp;rsquo; viewpoints until late adolescence or early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inability to empathize with each other results in &lt;em&gt;negative escalations&lt;/em&gt;. When one person wrongs or hurts another, the other person retaliates. The first underestimates the harm they incurred and so views the retaliation as out of proportion, which justifies further retaliation, leading to a &lt;em&gt;snowball effect&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;negative cascade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand establishing positive relationships cascades and results in lasting benefits. Marked improvements have been observed to occur the year &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; relationship-based interventions. Longitudinal studies have found persistent and profound benefits to positive teacher student relationships on a decadal scale. These positive relationships may help because they build trust that allows students to make mistakes and ask for help, and builds the confidence in students to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing positive relationships can be difficult if the focus is on responding to uncooperative students. Social psychology shows that &lt;em&gt;emotional leakage&lt;/em&gt; is common. Hiding emotions is difficult, and when a teacher has negative emotions towards a student the student may realize this. No major theory of learning recommends punitive action in response to difficult students. For example, high school students tend to attribute disciplinary action to the teacher (&amp;ldquo;teacher hats me&amp;rdquo;) rather than accept personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child has an unsupportive home environment, school can become a major source of social and cultural learning. Positive teacher-student relationships can be very influential in personal development in this stage and can mitigate the risk of negastive outcomes for children. On the other hand, positive at-home relationships can buffer negative relationships at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can these positive relationships be manufactured? A study found that just spending a few minute devoted to non-directive non-coercive friendly and child-centered activities positively influences teacher&amp;rsquo;s views for at-risk students.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your personality as a teacher</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-04/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-04/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly a century of research has shown that there is &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; a &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; personality for a teacher to have. Students value being treated with fairness, dignity, and respect much more than they value a particular personality type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been found that children lose respect for adults who violate basic social rules, exhibit cruelty, or otherwise break social conventions. Studies show that very young children possess a strong sense of what is right and wrong and have a deep sense of fairness. They may not behave in this manner, since social judgment and risk assessment develop much later. Almost universally though, basic misdeeds such as being caught lying incur significant degradation of trust and positive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that students evaluate teachers after exposure for as little as 10 seconds. This is an example of the &lt;em&gt;blink effect&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, these blink assessments are at least somewhat accurate, being correlated with ratings from actual students (although possible this could be an example of the blink effect itself being cemented in place in those genuine students). Deliberate use of warm and inviting body language, direct eye contact, and friendly intonation increased scores on academic tests for 7-year old students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very difficult to detect when children tell lies. Children develop skillful deceit at a very young age and from that point accuracy for telling lies is about 60% (barely above random chance). Rather, we are very good at detecting emotions, but emotions are poor indicators of deceit since truth-tellers often show signs of anxiety when placed under suspicion. Meanwhile liars may prepare for being grilled. Takeaway: do not expect to be able to tell if a student is lying from social cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking help in the classroom is a good thing, and should not be conflated with dependency (relying on a single source excessively and consistently). Help-seeking is associated with &amp;ldquo;mastery goal orientation&amp;rdquo; where students are motivated by factors involving understanding and acquiring knowledge. This contrasts with &amp;ldquo;ego orientation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;performance orientation&amp;rdquo; where the goal is to look good or outperform one&amp;rsquo;s immediate peers. Both orientatios coexist, but mastery orientation is associated with higher performance and deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students are more likely to seek help if they trust their teacher, and if their teacher encourages help-seeking behavour. As students age they begin to associate question-asking with low ability. However, with supportive teachers, students associate question asking more positively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Knowledge an Obstacle to Teaching?</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-02/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experts in a subject matter area seem to have worse intuition for teaching that subject matter, compared to novices
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory this is because they have learned to think about it in a structured and organized way that is not the most effective way to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; that material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experts consistently underestimated how difficult a task is. Novices, having just learned it, know how difficult it is to learn and teach a more basic level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although students rated novices higher and performed better on a post-teaching assessment, the expert-taught students performed better on transferring their learning to a related task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students appreciate being taught by knowledgeable, motivated, passionate individuals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students will rate their best teachers highly on competency, credibility, and fariness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More closely related to student motivation than actual learning. However children learn less from adults they view as ignorant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge about subject matter may make it harder to teach in a group setting, but on an individual level enables you to provide helpful feedback, and contextualize a student&amp;rsquo;s ideas and progress against your own knowledge base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
