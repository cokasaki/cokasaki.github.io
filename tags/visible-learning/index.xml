      <title>The teacher-student relationship</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-03/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;empathy gap&lt;/em&gt; occurs when people are relatively unable to put themselves in the place of another person. Deep levels of empathy are difficult if you have never had the same experience as another person, or if you are not currently experiencing anything similar. It is easiest to empathize with people whose experiences you are currently mirroring, harder if you have mirrored them in the past, and hardest if you have never experienced them at all. Children in particular do not develop the ability to deeply understand others&amp;rsquo; viewpoints until late adolescence or early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inability to empathize with each other results in &lt;em&gt;negative escalations&lt;/em&gt;. When one person wrongs or hurts another, the other person retaliates. The first underestimates the harm they incurred and so views the retaliation as out of proportion, which justifies further retaliation, leading to a &lt;em&gt;snowball effect&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;negative cascade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand establishing positive relationships cascades and results in lasting benefits. Marked improvements have been observed to occur the year &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; relationship-based interventions. Longitudinal studies have found persistent and profound benefits to positive teacher student relationships on a decadal scale. These positive relationships may help because they build trust that allows students to make mistakes and ask for help, and builds the confidence in students to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing positive relationships can be difficult if the focus is on responding to uncooperative students. Social psychology shows that &lt;em&gt;emotional leakage&lt;/em&gt; is common. Hiding emotions is difficult, and when a teacher has negative emotions towards a student the student may realize this. No major theory of learning recommends punitive action in response to difficult students. For example, high school students tend to attribute disciplinary action to the teacher (&amp;ldquo;teacher hats me&amp;rdquo;) rather than accept personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child has an unsupportive home environment, school can become a major source of social and cultural learning. Positive teacher-student relationships can be very influential in personal development in this stage and can mitigate the risk of negastive outcomes for children. On the other hand, positive at-home relationships can buffer negative relationships at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can these positive relationships be manufactured? A study found that just spending a few minute devoted to non-directive non-coercive friendly and child-centered activities positively influences teacher&amp;rsquo;s views for at-risk students.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your personality as a teacher</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-04/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-04/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly a century of research has shown that there is &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; a &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; personality for a teacher to have. Students value being treated with fairness, dignity, and respect much more than they value a particular personality type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been found that children lose respect for adults who violate basic social rules, exhibit cruelty, or otherwise break social conventions. Studies show that very young children possess a strong sense of what is right and wrong and have a deep sense of fairness. They may not behave in this manner, since social judgment and risk assessment develop much later. Almost universally though, basic misdeeds such as being caught lying incur significant degradation of trust and positive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that students evaluate teachers after exposure for as little as 10 seconds. This is an example of the &lt;em&gt;blink effect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Knowledge an Obstacle to Teaching?</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-02/</link>

&lt;li&gt;Experts in a subject matter area seem to have worse intuition for teaching that subject matter, compared to novices
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory this is because they have learned to think about it in a structured and organized way that is not the most effective way to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; that material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experts consistently underestimated how difficult a task is. Novices, having just learned it, know how difficult it is to learn and teach a more basic level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although students rated novices higher and performed better on a post-teaching assessment, the expert-taught students performed better on transferring their learning to a related task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students appreciate being taught by knowledgeable, motivated, passionate individuals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students will rate their best teachers highly on competency, credibility, and fariness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More closely related to student motivation than actual learning. However children learn less from adults they view as ignorant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge about subject matter may make it harder to teach in a group setting, but on an individual level enables you to provide helpful feedback, and contextualize a student&amp;rsquo;s ideas and progress against your own knowledge base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Broad Strokes of Learning</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/core-takeaways/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;nine-basic-principles-&#34;&gt;Nine basic principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanations of human learning in terms of innate talent are consistently undermined by research which states that substantial amounts of time, energy, instruction, and effort are required to develop mastery of any subject area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can naturally learn from any information, but to learn effectively that information has to be organized in a way that matches how our minds are organized. Minds are organized differently for different people, and even change as we age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brain has severe, inherent limitations and deep processing becomes impossible when those limits are reached (cognitive load principle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People learn particularly well from other people, through directed instruction and feedback (social learning theory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People put in a lot more effort when they are confident that worthwhile goals are achievable in the short term. Activating effort and motivation is difficult but not impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term goals are highly motivating, but when they conflict with valuable long-term goals we must develop and use strategies to control impulses and delay gratificatoin (personal regulation through self-control).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learners are humans, and other parts of them &amp;ndash; self esteem, sociality, etc &amp;ndash; must be maintained and acknowledged during the learning process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are fundamentally social, down to the neurological level. This sociality can be used as a tool (social brain hypothesis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas about learning that are contradicted by scientific evidence abound. Many of these ideas can be harmful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1-&#34;&gt;Section 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mind may not be &amp;ldquo;designed for thinking&amp;rdquo; and requires time and effort to think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers need to recognize how difficult tasks are for beginners. Focus should be not on material but on the actual process of moving from not knowing to knowing. To do this students need a safe environment to acknowledge they don&#39;t understand. We can only holld so much in our cognitive centers, so it is important to ``overlearn&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; basic concepts until it is ingrained and automatic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1-&#34;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students do not dislike school, but tolerate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brain may not be &amp;ldquo;designed&amp;rdquo; for abstract thinking and as a result school is a taxing process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking requires a large investment of resources for an uncertain outcome (understanding) and risk-averse humans prefer to invest these resources in crossing seemingly achievable &amp;ldquo;knowledge gaps&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;knowledge chasms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2-&#34;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experts may be &amp;ldquo;worse&amp;rdquo; at teaching than novices. The &amp;ldquo;expert blind spot effect&amp;rdquo; explains this:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experts forget how difficult it was to learn something in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a gap between the advanced level on which experts conceptualize of a topic and the short-term learning needs of students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;however, this abstract thinking may help students transfer their learning to related areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2-&#34;&gt;Section 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major ideas about acquisition, memory retention, mental storage, and overload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning need not be conscious, we can only think about so much at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to develop a vocabulary for learning, and need multiple strategies for learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges: learning styles (i.e. spatial, verbal, kinaesthetic), Mozart effects, multitasking, digital natives, and whether the Internet is really changing how we think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3-&#34;&gt;Section 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-esteem follows success more often than predicting it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building confidence is still important though: in order to maintain positive views of ourselves we build explanations (I cannot; rather than I did not work hard enough) that help our self esteem but hurt our learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning situations are often distracting and knowing how to pay attention to learning is important, but tiring. It is important to know when to stop thinking to save cognitive resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Why Don&#39;t Students Like School?</title>
      <link>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-01/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-01/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no serious evidence that students, on average, actively &lt;em&gt;dislike&lt;/em&gt; school. Rather they are neutral, or mildly positive towards school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frequent challenge faced by teachers is the apathy of students on an individual level, after working so hard to provide an engaging learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VL puts forward the following hypothesis, following researcher Daniel Willingham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human brain is not primarily designed for &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo;: it is designed for sociality, for language learning, for spatial reasoning, etc. Higher level reasoning is not the primary purpose and is, on average, very difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that thinking uses up limited resources very quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking someone to invest this level of effort/resources is a hard task. The outcome of a &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; task could be positive (better understanding) or negative (no progress). Humans are risk-averse and are unlikely to invest effort if they cannot see a likely short-term pay-off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means the best way to get effort out of students is to show them short-term goals that seem achievable: &amp;ldquo;we are motivated by knowledge gaps, but put off by knowledge chasms.&amp;rdquo; We cannot be curious about everything, and are instead curious about the things we feel we can understand with little additional effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ease with which people can access information has a large effect on how they use that information, and how they feel about that information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rely much more heavily on memory than thinking: it is generally easier to remember a previous result than to derive it from scratch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
