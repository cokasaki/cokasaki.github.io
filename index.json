That said, one of my big goals for the year, submitting my dam passage paper to Proc B, I have already accomplished! Hooray! Hopefully I can continue the momentum now that COVID-19 has well and truly set in.\nGoals I have a tendency to be overly ambitious with my goal timelines. I think I\u0026rsquo;m okay with that for now, but I\u0026rsquo;m trying to temper my expectations a little bit. I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that with my dam passage project behind me I can focus my time and make more steady progress on my other projects.\n Complete my bypass to the PhD track by April 1  This is a pretty near-term goal but has been a long time coming At this point most of what I need is just to do a bunch of lit reviewing and write up a beefier dissertation proposal than I had the first time round   Submit my source inference paper by August 1 2020  Hopefully the timeline on this is not too ambitious. I have a lot of the theory and code done already, but case studies, editting, and background reading take forever. Sub goal: Write up animal movement case study by April 10 Sub goal: Set up model and begin data analysis for pollen case study by April 17 Sub goal: Write up pollen case study by May 1 Sub goal: Complete third case study by June 5 Sub goal: Complete all background reading by June 5 Sub goal: Complete final editing by July 3 This leaves one month of wiggle room for things to take longer than I hope   Prepare to TA by September 15  This fall will be my first time TAing in any capacity since I was an undergrad. I will have more responsibility now than I did then and I want to make sure I am prepared. To do this I plan on doing background reading on teaching and TAing ahead of time. I know the best experience comes from doing but this is all I can do for now. Sub goal: Browse UW TAing resources  Sub goal: Browse CMU CollectedWisdom TAing resource  Sub goal: Read some of the evidence-based Visible Learning resources I haven\u0026rsquo;t assigned sub-goal deadlines because these are resources I intend to digest slowly over the period. Instead my goal is to do a little of this every week.   Submit my spatial survey design paper by Jan 1  I feel pretty good about getting the other goals done, if not on time, at least this year. This one is the stretch-iest of all of them. But I certainly won\u0026rsquo;t do it if I give up on it now! Sub goal: Find good spatial dataset by May 1 Sub goal: Complete background reading by July 3 Sub goal: Complete simulated case study by September 18 Sub goal: Complete final edits by December 1    ","date":1585008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585591621,"objectID":"60f289e0f35139fa7acd4576c7fd6be5","permalink":"/post/notebook/2020/annualpost-1/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/notebook/2020/annualpost-1/","section":"post","summary":"My annual lab notebook goals post for 2020","tags":["Notebook"],"title":"Lab Notebook: 2020","type":"post"},{"authors":["Colin Okasaki"],"categories":["Notebook"],"content":"Goals Morning: 9-12\n Set up virtual lab notebook and COVID-19 accountability structure  Afternoon: 1-3\n Add references for optimal design chapter  Afternoon: 3-5\n Refamiliarize myself with animal movement case study  Reality Morning: 9-12\n Set up virtual lab notebook and COVID-19 accountability structure  Afternoon: 1-4\n Add references for optimal design chapter  including major reference to Lee 1998, which actually does do logistically constrained optimal design but with a different objective function propose to compare performance of my method with his, as well as to speed up his method with sparse matrices    Afternoon: 4-5\n Work on new idea for logistically-constrained design  logistically-constrained random sampling? a number of possibilities for how to achieve it all rely upon being able to calculate or estimate $\\pi_i$ and $\\pi_{ij}$ the first- and second-order inclusion probabilities if we want to estimate them, can we define a Gaussian-like spatial process over second-order inclusion probabilities how can we do that? what is the domain of valid second-order inclusion probability matrices?
