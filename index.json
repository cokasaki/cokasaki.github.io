Make sure to check out my notation document to clarify any confusing notation.\nThe Model Simple Linear Regression is based upon the equation $$ y_i \\sim N(X\\beta,\\sigma^2) $$ or equivalently \\begin{align*} y_i \u0026amp; \\sim X\\beta + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\epsilon_i \u0026amp; \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2) \\end{align*} where the $\\epsilon_i$ are iid. In the context of regression, it is important to remember that: $E[y_i] = X\\beta$ and $E[\\epsilon_i] = 0$. We will assume that there are $n$ data points and $k$ predictors. This $\\beta$ is a $k\\times 1$ vector, $X$ is a $n\\times k$ matrix and $y$ and $\\epsilon$ are $n\\times 1$ vectors.\nFitting Objective Function To fit a simple linear regression we choose a measure of fit: least squares. This means we are looking for the parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared residuals. A residual is calculated by the difference between $y_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$, the value predicted by our fitted model. We can calculate $\\hat{y}_i$ using the $1\\times k$ vector $x_i$ of predictors for data point $i$: $$ \\hat{y}_i = x_i\\hat{\\beta}. $$ Alternatively we can find the whole vector $\\hat{y} = X\\beta$. To find a single squared residuals we calculate $r_i^2 = (y_i - x_i\\hat{\\beta})^2$. We will define the function $f(\\hat{\\beta})$ to be the sum of squared residuals, as a function of the fitted coefficients. We want to find the coefficients which minimize this function. We can calculate this as: \\begin{align*} f(\\hat{\\beta}) \u0026amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\mbox{residual})^2 \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i\\hat{\\beta})^2 \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}\\hat{\\beta}_j\\right)^2 \\end{align*} In matrix notation we can rewrite this, however. The residual *vector* can be written as the $n\\times 1$ vector $$ r = y - X\\hat{\\beta}. $$ The sum of squares can then be written as $r\u0026rsquo;r$. So then \\begin{align*} f(\\hat{\\beta}) \u0026amp; = r\u0026rsquo;r \\\\\n\u0026amp; = (y-X\\hat{\\beta})'(y-X\\hat{\\beta}). \\end{align*} We can expand this quadratic equation as \\begin{align*} f(\\hat{\\beta}) \u0026amp; = y\u0026rsquo;y - y\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta} - \\hat{\\beta}\u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;y + \\hat{\\beta}\u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta}. \\end{align*}\nOptimization From calculus, we can use the fact that the extrema (minimums and maximums) of a function occur when the partial derivatives of that function are equal to zero. So we want to take the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to each $\\beta_i$, to find the minimum sum of squared residuals (the least squares). So let us take the partial derivative with respect to a particular coefficient: \\begin{align*} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}_j} \u0026amp; = \\dfrac{\\partial }{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}_j} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}\\hat{\\beta}_j\\right)^2 \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{\\partial }{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}_j}\\left(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}\\hat{\\beta}_j\\right)^2 \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2\\left(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}\\hat{\\beta}_j\\right)\\dfrac{\\partial }{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}_j}\\left(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}\\hat{\\beta}_j\\right) \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2\\left(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}\\hat{\\beta}_j\\right)\\left(-x_{ij}\\right) \\\\\n\u0026amp; = -\\sum_{i=1}^n 2x_{ij}\\left(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}\\hat{\\beta}_j\\right)\\end{align*} Verify that this can be written in matrix notation as \\begin{align*} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}_j} \u0026amp; = -2\\left(X\u0026rsquo;y - X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta}\\right)_j, \\end{align*} or in matrix calculus notation \\begin{align*} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}} \u0026amp; = -2\\left(X\u0026rsquo;y - X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta}\\right). \\end{align*} Remember that according to calculus, every single entry $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{ \\partial \\beta_j}$ must be equal to zero at any extremum (and in particular at the minimum). Thus we can set this whole matrix equation equal to zero, and we get $$ X\u0026rsquo;y = X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta}. $$ Since we are trying to derive an equation for $\\hat{\\beta}$ we move the matrix over to the other side and we get $$ \\hat{\\beta} = (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}X\u0026rsquo;y. $$ We can derive this same equation in fewer steps using the more complex matrix calculus notation, which for example allows us to take the derivative of matrix products and use the matrix chain rule: \\begin{align*} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}} \u0026amp; = \\dfrac{\\partial }{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}}\\left(y\u0026rsquo;y - y\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta} - \\hat{\\beta}\u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;y + \\hat{\\beta}\u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta}\\right) \\\\\n\u0026amp; = - \\dfrac{\\partial }{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}}\\left(y\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta}\\right) - \\dfrac{\\partial }{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}}\\left(\\hat{\\beta}\u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;y\\right) + \\dfrac{\\partial }{ \\partial \\hat{\\beta}}\\left(\\hat{\\beta}\u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta}\\right) \\\\\n\u0026amp; = -y\u0026rsquo;X-(X\u0026rsquo;y)\u0026lsquo;+\\hat{\\beta}\u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;X + (X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta})\u0026rsquo; \\\\\n\u0026amp; = -2(X\u0026rsquo;y - X\u0026rsquo;X\\hat{\\beta})\u0026rsquo; \\\\\n\u0026amp; = 0. \\end{align*}\n","date":1585609200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585680397,"objectID":"364d8beeac805c4c54627b9f6ac6ff43","permalink":"/courses/qsci493/simple-linear-regression/","publishdate":"2020-03-31T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/qsci493/simple-linear-regression/","section":"courses","summary":"In this document I will outline the math used in the analysis of a simple linear regression model.

Learning","Notes"],"content":"Nine basic principles:\n Explanations of human learning in terms of innate talent are consistently undermined by research which states that substantial amounts of time, energy, instruction, and effort are required to develop mastery of any subject area. We can naturally learn from any information, but to learn effectively that information has to be organized in a way that matches how our minds are organized. Minds are organized differently for different people, and even change as we age. The brain has severe, inherent limitations and deep processing becomes impossible when those limits are reached (cognitive load principle) People learn particularly well from other people, through directed instruction and feedback (social learning theory) People put in a lot more effort when they are confident that worthwhile goals are achievable in the short term. Activating effort and motivation is difficult but not impossible. Short-term goals are highly motivating, but when they conflict with valuable long-term goals we must develop and use strategies to control impulses and delay gratificatoin (personal regulation through self-control). Learners are humans, and other parts of them \u0026ndash; self esteem, sociality, etc \u0026ndash; must be maintained and acknowledged during the learning process. Humans are fundamentally social, down to the neurological level. This sociality can be used as a tool (social brain hypothesis) Ideas about learning that are contradicted by scientific evidence abound. Many of these ideas can be harmful.  Section 1\n The mind may not be \u0026ldquo;designed for thinking\u0026rdquo; and requires time and effort to think Teachers need to recognize how difficult tasks are for beginners. Focus should be not on material but on the actual process of moving from not knowing to knowing. To do this students need a safe environment to acknowledge they don't understand. We can only holld so much in our cognitive centers, so it is important to ``overlearn\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; basic concepts until it is ingrained and automatic  Section 2\n Major ideas about acquisition, memory retention, mental storage, and overload Learning need not be conscious, we can only think about so much at once We need to develop a vocabulary for learning, and need multiple strategies for learning Challenges: learning styles (i.e. spatial, verbal, kinaesthetic), Mozart effects, multitasking, digital natives, and whether the Internet is really changing how we think  Section 3\n Self-esteem follows success more often than predicting it Building confidence is still important though: in order to maintain positive views of ourselves we build explanations (I cannot; rather than I did not work hard enough) that help our self esteem but hurt our learning Learning situations are often distracting and knowing how to pay attention to learning is important, but tiring. It is important to know when to stop thinking to save cognitive resources.

Rather they are neutral, or mildly positive towards school.\n  A frequent challenge faced by teachers is the apathy of students on an individual level, after working so hard to provide an engaging learning experience.\n  VL puts forward the following hypothesis, following researcher Daniel Willingham:\n The human brain is not primarily designed for \u0026ldquo;thinking\u0026rdquo;: it is designed for sociality, for language learning, for spatial reasoning, etc. Higher level reasoning is not the primary purpose and is, on average, very difficult. This means that thinking uses up limited resources very quickly Asking someone to invest this level of effort/resources is a hard task. The outcome of a \u0026ldquo;thinking\u0026rdquo; task could be positive (better understanding) or negative (no progress). Humans are risk-averse and are unlikely to invest effort if they cannot see a likely short-term pay-off. This means the best way to get effort out of students is to show them short-term goals that seem achievable: \u0026ldquo;we are motivated by knowledge gaps, but put off by knowledge chasms.\u0026rdquo; We cannot be curious about everything, and are instead curious about the things we feel we can understand with little additional effort    The ease with which people can access information has a large effect on how they use that information, and how they feel about that information\n  We rely much more heavily on memory than thinking: it is generally easier to remember a previous result than to derive it from scratch\n  ","date":1585526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585684146,"objectID":"d1ba0d9f0d5198a28fa374df8e0d9e7a","permalink":"/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-01/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/teaching/visible-learning/ch-01/","section":"post","summary":"My notes on Chapter 1 of Visible Learning","tags":["Teaching","Visible Learning"],"title":"Why Don't Students Like School?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Colin Okasaki"],"categories":["Notebook"],"content":"Goals I might be surprise-TAing next quarter, so I\u0026rsquo;m focusing all my energy on TA prep today.

I will post mathematical and scientific outputs such as documents and plots that I produced that day, and reflect on my productivity and time management.\n","date":1585008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585591621,"objectID":"3342f9c64fed4d1b8ad5c057d57ac455","permalink":"/post/notebook/outline/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/notebook/outline/","section":"post","summary":"Introducing a Virtual Lab Notebook","tags":["Notebook"],"title":"Lab Notebook Structure","type":"post"},{"authors":["Colin Okasaki"],"categories":["Notebook"],"content":"I am just starting this lab notebook now in March 2020, so almost a third of the year is behind me already. That said, one of my big goals for the year, submitting my dam passage paper to Proc B, I have already accomplished! Hooray! Hopefully I can continue the momentum now that COVID-19 has well and truly set in.\nGoals I have a tendency to be overly ambitious with my goal timelines. I think I\u0026rsquo;m okay with that for now, but I\u0026rsquo;m trying to temper my expectations a little bit. I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that with my dam passage project behind me I can focus my time and make more steady progress on my other projects.\n Complete my bypass to the PhD track by April 1  This is a pretty near-term goal but has been a long time coming At this point most of what I need is just to do a bunch of lit reviewing and write up a beefier dissertation proposal than I had the first time round   Submit my source inference paper by August 1 2020  Hopefully the timeline on this is not too ambitious. I have a lot of the theory and code done already, but case studies, editting, and background reading take forever. Sub goal: Write up animal movement case study by April 10 Sub goal: Set up model and begin data analysis for pollen case study by April 17 Sub goal: Write up pollen case study by May 1 Sub goal: Complete third case study by June 5 Sub goal: Complete all background reading by June 5 Sub goal: Complete final editing by July 3 This leaves one month of wiggle room for things to take longer than I hope   Prepare to TA by September 15  This fall will be my first time TAing in any capacity since I was an undergrad. I will have more responsibility now than I did then and I want to make sure I am prepared. To do this I plan on doing background reading on teaching and TAing ahead of time. I know the best experience comes from doing but this is all I can do for now. Sub goal: Browse UW TAing resources  Sub goal: Browse CMU CollectedWisdom TAing resource  Sub goal: Read some of the evidence-based Visible Learning resources I haven\u0026rsquo;t assigned sub-goal deadlines because these are resources I intend to digest slowly over the period. Instead my goal is to do a little of this every week.   Submit my spatial survey design paper by Jan 1  I feel pretty good about getting the other goals done, if not on time, at least this year. This one is the stretch-iest of all of them. But I certainly won\u0026rsquo;t do it if I give up on it now! Sub goal: Find good spatial dataset by May 1 Sub goal: Complete background reading by July 3 Sub goal: Complete simulated case study by September 18 Sub goal: Complete final edits by December 1    ","date":1585008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585591621,"objectID":"60f289e0f35139fa7acd4576c7fd6be5","permalink":"/post/notebook/2020/annualpost-1/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/notebook/2020/annualpost-1/","section":"post","summary":"My annual lab notebook goals post for 2020","tags":["Notebook"],"title":"Lab Notebook: 2020","type":"post"},{"authors":["Colin Okasaki"],"categories":["Notebook"],"content":"Goals Morning: 9-12\n Set up virtual lab notebook and COVID-19 accountability structure  Afternoon: 1-3\n Add references for optimal design chapter  Afternoon: 3-5\n Refamiliarize myself with animal movement case study  Reality Morning: 9-12\n Set up virtual lab notebook and COVID-19 accountability structure  Afternoon: 1-4\n Add references for optimal design chapter  including major reference to Lee 1998, which actually does do logistically constrained optimal design but with a different objective function propose to compare performance of my method with his, as well as to speed up his method with sparse matrices    Afternoon: 4-5\n Work on new idea for logistically-constrained design  logistically-constrained random sampling? a number of possibilities for how to achieve it all rely upon being able to calculate or estimate $\\pi_i$ and $\\pi_{ij}$ the first- and second-order inclusion probabilities if we want to estimate them, can we define a Gaussian-like spatial process over second-order inclusion probabilities how can we do that? what is the domain of valid second-order inclusion probability matrices?
